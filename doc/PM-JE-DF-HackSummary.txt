Connecting OM10 Time Delays and CosmoSIS
LSST DESC Hack Day October 30 2015
David Finley, Elise Jennings, Phil Marshall

First:
- PM and DF created OM10 fork for DF
	https://github.com/davidfinley/OM10
- PM modified OM10 to allow use of astropy
- MOCK DATA:
	- Used OM10 catalog to make 466 (z_lens, z_source) pairs at
	/Users/finley/TD_Cosmosis/OM10
	OM10_LSSTDESC.txt
	
- Lens system selection was as follows:
maglim = 22.0   # Faintest image must be well detected
area = 18000.0  # LSST WFD survey area (sq deg)
IMSEP > 1.0     # Well-resolved (!) quasar images (arcesec)
APMAG_I < 21.0  # Bright lens galaxies for follow-up velocity dispersions
DELAY > 10.0    # Longish time delays (days)

- EJ used Suyu et al arxiv_0910.2773.pdf
to create CosmoSIS modules to take (z_lens, z_source) [from above]
and append mock observations (D_delta_t, sigma_delta_t). [Assumed sigma_delta_t = 0.05 (5% precision per lens]
- DF and PM ran the modules on 466 lenses 
	cosmosis demos/OM10_LSSTDESC_generate.ini
 
- EJ created CosmoSIS modules for MOCK COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETER INFERENCE
- DF and PM used the second CosmoSIS module created by EJ in the “develop” branch of the CosmoSIS repository to take the four numbers for 466 lenses and infer H_0, etc.
	cosmosis demos/OM10_LSSTDESC_inference.ini
	and saved the output as demos/OM10_LSSTDESC_inferred_parameters.txt

The End.
